## About this project

I put this project together as a fun way to boost my development skills & help my D&D players get creative with the characters they were making. Hopefully in the future there will be additional expansions that I will put in place to select specific book data to inlcude and export the file for the users. Now that the main framework is built, I also want to work on adding additional character creation features such as alignment, age, gender, and height.
